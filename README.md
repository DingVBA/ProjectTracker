This spreadsheet is to automate the project list into the tracker.

A couple of techniques are used in this project:

1. Collection data structure.
   It's much easier and simpler in coding to only add the unique records rather than arrays etc.

2. Class module to get the column index
3. Add the auto filter
4. Visual progress bar
5. Excel range operation
